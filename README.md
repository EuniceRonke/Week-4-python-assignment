File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment
Description

This Python program demonstrates file reading and writing along with exception handling. The program reads a file provided by the user, 
modifies its content, and writes the modified content to a new file. It also handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.

Features

Reads content from a user-specified file.

Modifies each line of the file (currently converts text to uppercase).

Writes the modified content to a new file named modified_<original_filename>.

Handles common file errors using exception handling:

FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.

IOError if the file cannot be read or written.

Catches other unexpected errors.

Usage

Run the program:

python file_handling_assignment.py


Enter the name of the file you want to read.

The program creates a new file with the modified content in the same directory.

Learning Outcomes

Understand file operations in Python (open, read, write).

Apply exception handling to create robust and error-free programs.

Learn to modify and save file content programmatically.
